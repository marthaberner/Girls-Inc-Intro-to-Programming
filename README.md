# Girls Inc Intro to Programming

Claire and Martha introduce themselves

# Objectives (What)
* Be able to describe what software is / does
  * A program (set of instructions) that tells a computer how to do something
* Be able to describe what an algorithm is
  * Algorithms are parts of a program. A type of formula, or set of instructions
    * if this, then that. Otherwise, some other thing
* Be able to describe what debugging means
  * the process of finding and fixing broken parts of a program / algorithm
* Be able to write an algorithm in plain words, no code
* Be able to debug your 'algorithm'
* Be able to describe the difference between software and hardware

# Hooks (Engage them)

Computers can do all sorts of amazing things and we think of them as being super
smart, but did you know that a computer really can't do anything unless you tell it
how? So, while they can do amazing things, they still need humans to tell them how.
__It's not that they're smart, it's just that they're fast. They
only know how to do what we tell them, but they can do it way faster than we can.__

* How many of you use computers? (probably everyone)
* How many of you use software? (they probably don't know that's what apps are)
  * Instagram
  * Snapchat√Ç
  * Kik
  * Whatsapp
  * What are your favorite apps?
  * How does software work?
* Software works by using programs that tell the computer what to do.
  * Who's posts should be show to you?
  * Who are you?
  * Who are your friends?
  * What things do you like?
* What is the difference between software and hardware?
  * Hardware is like the skeleton and organs, software is the brain

# Process (How)

__After 'Hooks' discussion:__
* Girls break up into pairs (pen and paper each)
* Each girl writes an 'algorithm' that instructs a robot how to make a pb & j
* Each girl takes a turn being the robot and follows the other's instruction verbatum
* Girls identify the 'bugs' in their program and fix 'agorithm' accordingly

Ask for a set of volunteers to attempt to act out algorithm in front of group:

## If Extra Time

* Trivia of objectives
* Pair up and write more algorithms (girls come up with their own idea)
